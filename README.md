This is a project created as the semester final project for the Data Structure course at North South University.

----------


Features
-------------

To keep the everything as simple as possible, we included 2 common features just to show the meaning of the given word and show its list of synonyms.

> **Word Meaning Module**

> Trie Data Structure was used to solve this. At the end of every node the meaning of the word was kept.

> **Synonym Module**

> We built a Graph from a List of pre determined synonyms list file. Then we used Depth First Search to show the list of elements that are in the same component. This means the words returned are its synonyms.
